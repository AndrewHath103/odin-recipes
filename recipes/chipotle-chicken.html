        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This copycat Chipotle chicken begins with a flavorful chipotle marinade, then is seared in a skillet and finished in the oven.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 chipotle peppers plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce (from 1 can chipotles in adobo)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for cooking</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine chicken, garlic, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, 3 tablespoons olive oil, cumin, white vinegar, salt, pepper, and honey in a 
                    large resealable bag. Seal bag and toss to coat thoroughly.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to overnight.</li>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

                <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add a little oil if necessary. Add chicken in one layer to skillet and cook, 
                    undisturbed, until chicken is deep golden brown and releases easily from the skillet, 5 to 7 minutes.</li> 

                <li>Flip chicken and transfer to the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. 
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let chicken rest 10 minutes before 
                    cutting.</li>
            </ol>
