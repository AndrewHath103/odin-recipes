# odin-recipes

This project comes from the Foundations of the Odin Project and is called Recipes. The goal is to build a basic recipe website using the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far. Such as creating an html properly along with using headers, paragraphs, links, and images. The project will also server as a place to practice using and getting more familiar with GitHub.

It should contain a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The website does not have to look pretty.
