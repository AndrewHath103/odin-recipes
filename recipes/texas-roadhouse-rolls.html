        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Now you don’t have to take a trip to Texas Roadhouse to get your hands on those soft, sweet, and irresistibly fluffy rolls. Our copycat version delivers the same warm and comforting delight of those signature dinner rolls—right from your very own oven.

            “These went fast in the test kitchen, proving there is nothing better than bread straight out of the oven,” said recipe tester Elizabeth Mervosh. “These rolls were very easy to make and didn’t require shaping, which I loved. They’re like soft little pillows of goodness!”

            Not only do these rolls taste just like the real thing, they even have the iconic Roadhouse roll look, with a square, domed shape and a glossy, golden brown exterior. But, no basket of fresh-baked rolls is complete without our Copycat Cinnamon Honey Butter, which adds a sweet richness to every warm, tender bite.
