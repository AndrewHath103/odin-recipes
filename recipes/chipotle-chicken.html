        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    3 cloves garlic, minced
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    2 chipotle peppers plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce (from 1 can chipotles in adobo)
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for cooking
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    1 teaspoon ground cumin
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    2 tablespoons white vinegar
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    1 tablespoon honey
                </ul>
            </li>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <li>
                <ol>Combine chicken, garlic, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, 3 tablespoons olive oil, cumin, white vinegar, salt, pepper, and honey in a 
                    large resealable bag. Seal bag and toss to coat thoroughly.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to overnight.</ol>

                <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</ol>

                <ol>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add a little oil if necessary. Add chicken in one layer to skillet and cook, 
                    undisturbed, until chicken is deep golden brown and releases easily from the skillet, 5 to 7 minutes.</ol> 

                <ol>Flip chicken and transfer to the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. 
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let chicken rest 10 minutes before 
                    cutting.</ol>
            </li>
